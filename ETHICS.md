# Ethics and Considerations

This project involves scraping publicly available flight price data from Kayak and retrieving weather data from the OpenWeather API. While the project is primarily educational, ethical considerations should always be taken into account when working with web scraping, data handling, and public APIs.

## Web Scraping Ethics

Web scraping can be a powerful tool for gathering data, but it should be done responsibly and in accordance with legal and ethical guidelines.

1. **Respect Terms of Service**: 
   - Always review and comply with the terms of service of the websites you scrape. Many websites, including Kayak, have explicit terms regarding data scraping.
   - Violating a website’s terms of service can lead to legal consequences or result in being blocked from accessing the site.

2. **Avoid Overloading Servers**: 
   - Be mindful of the frequency and volume of your requests to a server. Sending too many requests in a short period can strain the website’s infrastructure, impacting both the site’s functionality and other users.
   - Implement delays between requests if you are scraping multiple pages, and avoid scraping large amounts of data in a short time frame.

3. **Use APIs When Available**: 
   - Whenever possible, prefer using official APIs rather than scraping websites. APIs are designed for efficient data access and typically provide structured data in a reliable format. 
   - This project uses the OpenWeather API to gather weather data instead of scraping weather websites.

## Data Privacy and Use

1. **Publicly Available Data**: 
   - The flight prices retrieved from Kayak are publicly available, and this project does not involve scraping or using personal user data. It is essential to ensure that any data you collect does not infringe on the privacy of others.
   
2. **Compliance with Laws**: 
   - Always ensure that your scraping and data usage practices comply with relevant local and international laws, including privacy laws like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe.
   - This project does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring compliance with data protection standards.
